# Diabetes Detection using Eye Images
This is an interesting project that targets the domain of Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence.
We have eye images which we have segmented and assigned labels using k-elbow and k-means clustering. Our goal is to classify the labels of these images and predict if there are signs of diabetes or not.
I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) along with traditional machine learning algorithms to classify the images.
To read the images and train the CNN model in batches, I had to create a custom data loader given in the notebook.
The code mostly utilizes the functionality provided by PyTorch, Scikit-Sklearn, and opencv.
The results are recorded in the form of graphs and are uploaded to the repository.
